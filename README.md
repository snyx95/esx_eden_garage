# esx_eden_garage
Private garage based on ESX

# Requirement:

The garage only takes into account the vehicles purchased in the dealership and also the vehicles that are outside or outside.
During a reboot all vehicles go back home.

1) It is necessary to apply the SQL
2) Put the resource in your server.cfg
3) Edit the config to add garage or edit
