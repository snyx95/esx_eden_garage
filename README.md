# esx_eden_garage
Private garage based on ESX

Requirement:
FXServer-esx_vehicleshop

The garage only takes into account the vehicles purchased in the dealership and also the vehicles that are outside or outside.
During a reboot all vehicles go back home.

1) It is necessary to apply the SQL
2) Put the resource in your server.cfg
3) Edit the config to add garage or edit

KNOWN BUG:

- Some vehicles are impossible to enter
- By looking good it is possible to duplicate vehicles

We work on it.

Operation:
The yellow circle to go out / back vehicule / recuperer vehicle (in case of depop this one)
To fit a vehicle, put it in the red circle then go into the yellow circle and bring in the vehicle
